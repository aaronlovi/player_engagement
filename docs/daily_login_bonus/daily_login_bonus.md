## 🕹️ Daily Login Bonus — Summary of Forms & Engagement Loops

| Form / Mechanic | Description | Motivation Loops Involved | Engagement Impact |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **1. XP Grant** | Award a fixed amount of XP upon login. May increase with streak length (e.g., +10 → +50 over a week). | **Habit Loop**, **Progression Loop** | Builds daily login habit and provides a visible sense of progress toward next level or rank. |
| **2. XP Multiplier Buff** | Give a 1.5× or 2× XP multiplier for the first few matches of the day. | **Habit**, **Reward**, **Mastery** | Encourages players not just to log in but also to *play right away* to take advantage of the buff. |
| **3. Streak Rewards** | Reward escalating bonuses for consecutive logins (coins, XP, cosmetics, etc.). Reset or decay if missed. | **Habit**, **Progression**, **Identity** | Encourages routine and “loss aversion” (don’t break my streak). Adds tension and accomplishment. |
| **4. Daily Chest / Spin** | Tap-to-open bonus chest or wheel of prizes. Randomized reward (coins, XP, cosmetics). | **Reward**, **Habit** | Adds a small dopamine hit each day, rewarding participation with variety and anticipation. |
| **5. Social Share Boost** | After claiming daily reward, optionally share progress or invite a friend for a small XP bonus. | **Social**, **Identity**, **Habit** | Adds virality and reinforces identity through public activity. |
| **6. Game-Specific Boosts** | Give each game (e.g., Connect 4, Tic Tac Toe) a “+1 XP match” bonus for that day. | **Variety**, **Progression**, **Habit** | Nudges users to try different games and keeps the experience fresh. |
| **7. Cosmetic Tokens** | Occasionally grant aesthetic unlock currency (avatar frames, board skins). | **Identity**, **Reward** | Strengthens player attachment through visual ownership and self-expression. |
| **8. Leaderboard Streak Display** | Publicly display “login streak” badges or icons beside usernames. | **Identity**, **Social**, **Progression** | Recognition of consistency creates positive peer pressure and prestige. |
| **9. Daily Challenge Unlock** | Logging in unlocks that day’s unique challenge or mission (win 3 Connect 4 matches, etc.). | **Reward**, **Mastery**, **Habit** | Couples login with gameplay objectives, deepening the loop beyond mere presence. |
| **10. Cumulative Milestone Rewards** | After 30 total logins, earn special frames, titles, or rare badges. | **Progression**, **Identity**, **Event** | Converts short-term login behavior into a long-term retention system. |

## 🔁 How It Drives Engagement

- **Immediate feedback:** Reward received on login triggers the **Reward Loop**.  
- **Predictable progress:** Visible streaks reinforce the **Habit Loop** and **Progression Loop**.  
- **Meaningful play incentive:** XP multipliers and daily challenges pull users into matches (bridging to **Mastery Loop**).  
- **Personalization:** Cosmetic unlocks engage the **Identity Loop**.  
- **Social visibility:** Streaks and shared bonuses enhance the **Social Loop**.

In short, the daily login bonus acts as an **anchor mechanic** that bridges multiple motivation loops — habit, reward, progression, mastery, and identity — giving returning players both *immediate gratification* and *long-term purpose*.
